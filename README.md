# Signal Estimator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gavv/signal-estimator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gavv/signal-estimator)

## Features

`signal-estimator` is a small command-line tool allowing to measure different characteristics of the signal looped back from audio output to audio input.

Features:

* send test signal to output device and receive looped back signal from input device
* measure signal latency (the shift between output and input signal)
* measure signal loss ratio (number of glitches per second in the input signal)
* dump output and input streams to text files and plot them using matplotlib

## Example use cases

* Measure local hardware latency.

  *Example setups:*

  * connect computer's audio output to its audio input using a jack cable
  * place computer's speakers near the its microphone

* Measure total latency and signal quality of an external hardware + software system.

  *Example setups:*

  * measure Raspberry Pi hardware + software latency

    connect computer's audio output to a Raspberry Pi's input and vice versa, and run a program on Raspberry Pi that loops back signal from input to output

  * measure hardware + software + network latency / quality of the two Raspberry Pies connected via a network transport

    connect computer's audio output to the first Raspberry Pi's input, and computer's audio input to the second Raspberry Pi's output, and connect the two Raspberry Pies using some network audio transport

  * measure the hardware + software + bluetooth latency / quality of a mobile phone with bluetooth microphone and headphones

    place computer's speakers near bluetooth microhpone connected to a mobile phone, place computer's microhpone near bluetooth headphones conencted to the phone, and run a mobile app that loops back signal from bluetooth microphone to bluetooth headphones

  In these examples, you'll need to measure the latency of your local harware first, and then subtract it ftom the measurements results, to get the actual latency of the external system being tested.
